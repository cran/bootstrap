This is an R port of Efron & Tibshirani's boostrap S-library that
accompanies their 1993 book `An introduction to the bootstrap'.

Changes from original:

	changed all dyn.load2 calls to use dyn.load

	fixed call of boott (had 2 variable argument lists)

	restructered help files for R consistency

	added dummy help page for data and internal functions
